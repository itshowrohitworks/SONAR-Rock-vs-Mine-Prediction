# SONAR Object Classification: Rocks vs Mines

## 1. Project Description:
This project classifies sonar signals as either Rocks (R) or Mines (M) using machine learning. It demonstrates the complete pipeline for building a classification model, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to model training and evaluation. The implementation leverages Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 2. Features
Binary classification of sonar signals.
Data preprocessing and visualization.
Machine learning model training and evaluation.
Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Prerequisites
Python >= 3.7
Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 3. Steps in the SONAR R vs M Project
### 1. Importing Libraries
Imported necessary Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
These libraries were used for data manipulation, analysis, and building the classification model.

### 2. Loading the Dataset
The SONAR dataset was loaded into the environment.
Inspected the dataset to understand its structure, including the number of rows, columns, and types of data.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explored the dataset to identify patterns or anomalies.
Conducted visualizations to understand the relationship between features and the target labels (Rocks and Mines).

### 4. Data Preprocessing
Normalization: Scaled the feature values to bring them into a consistent range. This helps many machine learning models perform better.
Train-Test Split: Divided the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

### 5. Model Selection
Choose a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest).
Defined the model parameters and trained it using the training data.

### 6. Model Training
Fitted the selected model(s) on the training data.
Focused on learning the relationship between features and target labels (R or M).

### 7. Model Evaluation
Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like:
Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.

### 8. Predictions on Test Data
Used the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

### 9. Results Analysis
The model's accuracy scores on the training and testing data are as follows:
Accuracy on Training Data: 83.42%
Accuracy on Testing Data: 76.19%
These results indicate that the model performs well on the training set and maintains decent accuracy on unseen test data, suggesting a balanced learning process.
